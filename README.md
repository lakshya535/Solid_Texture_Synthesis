# Computer Graphics Project

This repository contains the code for the Computer Graphics project - Mid Evaluation (Project 11, Group 6).

## Instructions for Running the Project

1. After extracting the 'MidEvaluation_Project_11_Group_6.zip' file, navigate to the project directory:

    ```
    cd Computer_Graphics_Project
    ```

2. Change into the 'CG_Project_Code' directory:

    ```
    cd CG_Project_Code
    ```

3. Run the build script to compile the project:

    ```
    ./build.sh
    ```

4. Execute the main program to run the Solid Texture Synthesis:

    ```
    ./SolidTextureFrom2DExemplar
    ```

**Note:** OpenCV is assumed to be installed. Ensure that you have the necessary dependencies installed and configured for building and running the project.

For any additional information or issues, please refer to the project documentation.
